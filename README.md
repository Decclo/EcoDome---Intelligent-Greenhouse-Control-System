# EcoDome---Intelligent-Greenhouse-Control-System
For the 6th semester bachelor project of the Mechatronics BSc in Engineering at University of Southern Denmark (SDU) a control system was developed for the Green Makerspace EcoDome, an experimental greenhouse which aims at extending the seasons and keeping the temperature within a set limit. This project focuses on control theory and the corresponding software, as the EcoDome already exists, and uses prognoses from local weather forecasting services as well as active heat storages.  To prepare the EcoDome for the prototype small changes were made to the hardware and mechanics, including installing flex tubes to increase the efficiency of the heat storages.  During the project a working prototype was developed which fulfilled the overall requirements of the project. The prototype is capable of regulating the environment in the EcoDome using air circulation and stone beds, however, the currently installed actuators are not powerful enough to keep the environment within the set limitations during the extreme weather experienced in May of 2018 in Denmark.
